Answerlist

Solution
========
**Feedback**: Researchers should always be honest about all aspects of a research project. Itâ€™s fine to deviate from your original plans, as long as you explain any changes clearly. You are absolutely free to report unexpected findings and exploratory analyses beyond what you specified in your preregistration, these should just be discussed separately from the preregistered analyses.
