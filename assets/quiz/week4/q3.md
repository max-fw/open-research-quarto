Question
========
3.  Why is it important to distinguish between confirmatory and exploratory analyses? (Select one)

Answerlist
----------
* To clarify which analyses were pre-planned and which were data-driven
* To determine the funding sources for each analysis
* To enhance the complexity of the research 
* To limit the scope of the study

Solution
========
**Feedback**: Differentiating between which analyses were pre-planned and which were data-driven means that you wonâ€™t be able to convince yourself (or others) that you had hypotheses before you saw your data, when actually you thought of these explanations after seeing the results. This helps you avoid questionable research practices.
