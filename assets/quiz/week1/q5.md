Question
========
5. What is an example of a lack of accessibility?

Answerlist
----------
* An article written in a very technical way, with no summary for the public
* A research paper written using green and red text
* Researchers having to pay thousands of pounds to publish their article
* An article published in an online journal which readers have to pay to download articles from
* An article published on publicly accessible website

Solution
========
**Feedback**: If an article is published in a journal behind a paywall, only those who can afford it can access it. Similarly, if researchers must pay to publish their article, then only researchers who have the funding to do this can publish. Red and green text could make an article less accessible for those with one type of colour-blindness. Even if an article is published openly, if there is no non-specialist summary for the public, then they still may not be able to learn from the research.
