Question
========
2. Which of the following are most likely to be benefits of sharing your research data and materials? (Select one or more)

Answerlist
----------
* It enables secondary data analysis addressing different research questions
* It gives publicity to your participants’ messages
* It allows others to reproduce analyses reported in a paper and expand on them
* It makes the analysis easier
* It provides checks on the quality and accuracy of research findings

Solution
========
**Feedback**:
Publicising participants’ issues is unlikely to be a benefit, and could pose a risk to participants unless the release of information has been carefully agreed. Open research is just as rigorous as any other research – arguably more so, since your methods are potentially open to wider scrutiny!
