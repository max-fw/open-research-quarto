**Feedback**: Despite the name, a preprint can be published whether or not you have published or intend to publish in a journal (as long as the publisher allows this). Reread Week 6 to remind yourself of different publishing models and check different publishersâ€™ rules on preprints in Sherpa Romeo, https://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/.
