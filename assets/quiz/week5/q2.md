Answerlist
----------
* The size of the research team

Solution
========
**Feedback**: Positionality refers to an individual's social and political position within society, including their identity, background, experiences, and beliefs. This is the best definition. It is also conceivable the place of research could affect a researcher’s positionality. For instance, if a researcher works for a research institute in a country in the Global South, they may have experiences and beliefs relating to that particular country and culture.
