Accessible research: Research is accessible if all who are interested can consume, evaluate, and otherwise interact with research products and processes.
Accessible_: Research data is accessible if it can be accessed by anyone in the world, either openly or through an authentication or authorisation process. This requires metadata describing it in a standardised format.
Accessibility: (From FORRT Glossary) Accessibility refers to the ease of access and re-use of materials (e.g., data, code, outputs, publications) for academic purposes, particularly the ease of access is afforded to people with a chronic illness, disability and/or neurodivergence. 
Between1: A between study design compares different conditions between groups, a within design compares different conditions within the same group, and a mixed study combines the two.
Big team science: A research project in which researchers from around the world conduct the same study and pool their results.
Business models: A business model is the plan of a company for how it will make a profit.
Conceptual replications: A type of replication study which aims to vary some aspect of the original study, in order to better understand the underlying phenomenon.
Confirmatory analyses: Analyses set before data collection or examination; their role is to test hypotheses.
Constraints on generality: A statement identifying populations sampled in the study and potential limits to the samples and methods, enabling others to assess the extent to which results can be generalised.
Counterbalancing: A technique used by psychologists to deal with order effects when conducting repetitive tests, giving half the participants the tests in one order, the other half in the reverse order.
Creative Commons license: A Creative Commons license enables reusers to distribute, remix, adapt and build upon the material, as long as they abide by conditions set by the author.
Data_: The information or facts collected, observed, or generated during the course of a study or investigation.
data dictionary: A data dictionary is a collection of names, definitions, and attributes about data elements being used in shared data.
data management plan: (From FORRT Glossary) A structured document that describes the process of data acquisition, analysis, management and storage during a research project. It also describes data ownership and how the data will be preserved and shared during and upon completion of a project. 
dependent variable: In a scientific experiment design, this is the variable that changes as a result of an intervention; the researcher is interested in recording these changes.
Direct replications: A type of replication study which aims to stay as close to the original study as possible.
Equity: Equity means the quality of being fair or impartial. In education, it is understood as presenting all scholars with the same opportunities, which sometimes requires making adjustments for their particular needs.
Exploratory analyses: Analyses set after an initial data set and hypothesis have been generated; they are useful for discovering patterns in data, in order to foster hypothesis development and refinement.
false negative: An error that occurs when a researcher believes that there is no effect or difference, when actually there is (e.g. a person has a negative Covid test although they do have Covid).
false positive: An error that occurs when a researcher believes that there is a genuine effect or difference when there is not (e.g. a person has a positive Covid test although they do not have Covid).
FAIR: (From FORRT Glossary) Describes making scholarly materials Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). Findable and Accessible are concerned with where materials are stored (e.g. in data repositories), while Interoperable and Reusable focus on the importance of data formats and how such formats might change in the future.
Findable: Research data is more findable by interested parties if it is stored in a well-organised repository with detailed metadata and persistent identifiers.
Generalisability: The extent to which the findings of a study can be generalised to other situations, beyond the specific participants and conditions of the study.
HARK-ing: Researchers are HARK-ing if they write papers as if they had a hypothesis they wanted to test in their study, whereas in reality, they made up the hypothesis after seeing the results.
Hypothesis1: (From FORRT Glossary) A hypothesis is an unproven statement relating the connection between variables (Glass & Hall, 2008) and can be based on prior experiences, scientific knowledge, preliminary observations, theory and/or logic. In scientific testing, a hypothesis can be usually formulated with (e.g. a positive correlation) or without a direction (e.g. there will be a correlation). Popper (1959) posits that hypotheses must be falsifiable, that is, it must be conceivably possible to prove the hypothesis false.
independent variable: In a scientific experiment design, this is the variable that the researcher manipulates in order to investigate its effect.
Integrity: The principle of integrity refers to the degree of trustworthiness or believability of research findings.
Interoperable: Datasets are interoperable if they can be used together to generate new studies. The metadata uses standard vocabularies, which are consistent across lots of different datasets.
Materials: Anything used in a study, e.g., questionnaires, consent forms, protocols outlining what was done, the code used to run any statistical analyses, etc.
metadata: Information that accompanies a piece of research, organising the materials, data and publications.
multiverse analysis: Systematically sampling a vast set of specifications, known as a multiverse, to estimate the uncertainty surrounding the validity of a scientific claim.
Open access: Open access is the free, immediate, online availability of research outputs such as journal articles without having to pay a fee, combined with the rights to use these outputs fully in the digital environment.
Open_: Data and materials from an open study are freely available to be used, reused, and redistributed by anyone.
Phack1: (From FORRT Glossary) Exploiting techniques that may artificially increase the likelihood of obtaining a statistically significant result by meeting the standard statistical significance criterion (typically α = .05). 
P-hacking: In quantitative research, exploiting techniques that increase the likelihood of obtaining a statistically significant result.
p-value: A p-value is a statistical measurement used to validate a hypothesis against observed data. The lower the p-value, the greater the significance of the observed difference.
Positionality: Refers to the social and political position of an individual within society, including their identity, background, experiences, and beliefs.
Post-hoc justifications: Researchers write up justifications for their actions after a study; these justifications were not planned or decided before the study happened.
Preprint: An open-access version of your work (either before, after, or instead of publication in a journal) hosted on a preprint server. Preprints are a way to ensure that your work is openly accessible to others, regardless of where you publish your research.
Preregistration: The practice of publishing the plan for a study, including research questions or hypotheses, research design, and data analysis plans, before the data has been collected or examined.
Privilege: Privilege is unearned access or advantage, which specific groups of people have because of their membership of a particular social group.
Qual1: (From FORRT Glossary) Research which uses non-numerical data, such as textual responses, images, videos or other artefacts, to explore in-depth concepts, theories, or experiences. There are a wide range of qualitative approaches, from micro-detailed exploration of language or focusing on personal subjective experiences, to those which explore macro-level social experiences and opinions.
Qualitative: A qualitative method is used to identify, analyse and report patterns (themes) in non-numerical data.
Quantitative: Quantitative methods deal with numbers, aiming to quantify phenomena and establish patterns or relationships.
reflex1: (From FORRT Glossary) The process of reflexivity refers to critically considering the knowledge that we produce through research, how it is produced, and our own role as researchers in producing this knowledge. There are different forms of reflexivity; personal reflexivity whereby researchers consider the impact of their own personal experiences, and functional whereby researchers consider the way in which our research tools and methods may have impacted knowledge production. Reflexivity aims to bring attention to underlying factors which may impact the research process, including development of research questions, data collection, and the analysis.
reflexivity: An idea borrowed from qualitative research, reflexivity involves critical reflection on researcher positionality and how it influences the research process.
Registration: Some disciplines differentiate between preregistration and registration, but the broad purpose is often similar.
Replicability: A study is replicable if you are able to conduct the same study again, generate new data, and still get the same results as the original study.
"Reproduc1": A minimum standard on a spectrum of activities (“reproducibility spectrum”) for assessing the value or accuracy of scientific claims based on the original methods, data, and code. For instance, where the original researcher’s data and computer codes are used to regenerate the results (Barba, 2018), often referred to as computational reproducibility. 
Replicat1: (From FORRT Glossary) The finding, and related shift in academic culture and thinking, that a large proportion of scientific studies published across disciplines do not replicate (e.g. Open Science Collaboration, 2015). This is considered to be due to a lack of quality and integrity of research and publication practices, such as publication bias, QRPs and a lack of transparency, leading to an inflated rate of false positive results. Others have described this process as a "Credibility revolution" towards improving these practices. 
Reproducibility: A study is reproducible if you are able to get the same results when conducting the same analyses on the same data as the original study.
Research degrees of freedom: The flexibility inherent in research, from hypothesis generation, designing and conducting a research study, to processing and analysing the data and interpreting and reporting results.
Reusable: Research data is reusable if it can be used, modified or analysed, potentially by other researchers, to generate new knowledge. It needs to include clear information to facilitate re-use.
Robustness: Refers to the strength and reliability of results.
Sampling variation: The extent to which the data vary in different samples taken from the same population.
Secondary_: A type of study where you use existing data to answer new questions.
Selective reporting: Researchers are selective reporting if their results are deliberately not fully or accurately reported, in order to suppress negative or undesirable findings.
Slack community: A Slack is a simple discussion forum, with different channels helping to organise separate conversations for specific subgroups. 
Systematic1: (From FORRT Glossary) A form of literature review and evidence synthesis. A systematic review will usually include a thorough, repeatable (reproducible) search strategy including key terms and databases in order to find relevant literature on a given topic or research question. Systematic reviewers follow a process of screening the papers found through their search, until they have filtered down to a set of papers that fit their predefined inclusion criteria. These papers can then be synthesised in a written review which may optionally include statistical synthesis in the form of a meta-analysis as well. 
Systematic review: A structured literature review, which analyses existing research evidence according to a fixed set of criteria, then synthesises what the research evidence shows. 
Transparent: The principle of transparency in research refers to the practice of being open and honest about all aspects of the research process.
